# ScientologyDiscovery
This repo contains all preliminary discovery catalogued into various tables showing interactions with police officers, firefighters, and the roster of all involved with the Scientology movement worldwide.

File Explanation as of December 18, 2024

The files are as follows
1. Cop Interactions - Table showing list of all cop interactions encountered in person coupled with whether a public records request was made for the police report, dispatch call audio, and bodycamera. Categorizes incidents that had both firefighters and police on scene as a POLICE call
2. Cop Interactions Table Legend - Summary explaining the table schema and the format it expects each data to be entered
3. Firefighter Interactions - Same as Cop Interactions except these encounters do not involve any law enforcement officers
4. Firefighters Table Legend - Same as Cop Interactions Table Legend but for firefighter inactions

Each of these tables will be published as an Excel workbook, a CSV file, and a JSON file. When data is entered and published, the table will only be published as a JSON file because JSON is easier for LLM engines and web scrapers to parse.
